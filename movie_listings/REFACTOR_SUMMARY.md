# Movie List App - Refactored Structure

## Overview
The Movie List App has been refactored from a single large `App.jsx` file into a modular, maintainable structure with separate components and custom hooks.

## File Structure

```
src/
├── App.jsx                    # Main application component (172 lines, reduced from 602)
├── App.css                    # Global styles
├── main.jsx                   # Application entry point
├── components/                # Reusable UI components
│   ├── Header.jsx            # Search bar and add movie button
│   ├── MovieCard.jsx         # Individual movie card component
│   ├── MovieGrid.jsx         # Grid layout for movie cards
│   ├── DragCard.jsx          # Individual draggable ranking card
│   ├── DragDropPanel.jsx     # Right panel with drag-and-drop functionality
│   ├── MovieModal.jsx        # Shared modal for add/edit movie forms
│   ├── MovieDetailModal.jsx  # Modal for displaying movie details
│   └── FloatingCard.jsx      # Floating card shown during drag operations
└── hooks/                     # Custom React hooks
    ├── useMovies.js          # Movie state management and operations
    └── useDragAndDrop.js     # Drag and drop functionality
```

## Components

### Core Components
- **App.jsx** (172 lines) - Main application orchestrator, handles modal states and event coordination
- **Header.jsx** - Search functionality and add movie button
- **MovieGrid.jsx** - Left panel containing the movie collection
- **DragDropPanel.jsx** - Right panel with draggable ranking cards

### UI Components
- **MovieCard.jsx** - Individual movie display with edit/delete actions
- **DragCard.jsx** - Individual draggable card in the ranking panel
- **MovieModal.jsx** - Reusable modal for both adding and editing movies
- **MovieDetailModal.jsx** - Modal for displaying detailed movie information
- **FloatingCard.jsx** - Card that follows cursor during drag operations

## Custom Hooks

### useMovies.js
Manages all movie-related state and operations:
- Movie collection state
- Search functionality
- CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Drag card synchronization
- Filtered movie list

### useDragAndDrop.js
Handles all drag-and-drop functionality:
- Drag state management
- Mouse event handling
- Drop zone detection
- Reorder operations
- Visual feedback during dragging

## Benefits of Refactoring

### 1. **Improved Readability**
- Each component has a single responsibility
- Reduced cognitive load when reading code
- Clear separation of concerns

### 2. **Better Maintainability**
- Changes to UI components don't affect business logic
- Easier to locate and fix bugs
- Isolated testing of individual components

### 3. **Reusability**
- Components can be reused in other parts of the application
- Custom hooks can be shared across components
- Modal component handles both add and edit operations

### 4. **Enhanced Developer Experience**
- Faster development with focused, smaller files
- Better IDE support and autocomplete
- Easier code navigation

### 5. **Performance Benefits**
- Better tree-shaking with separated modules
- Potential for lazy loading components
- Easier optimization of individual components

## Key Features Maintained

✅ **All Original Functionality Preserved**
- Movie CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Drag-and-drop ranking with visual feedback
- Search functionality
- Responsive design
- Modal interactions
- Chakra UI icons integration

✅ **State Management**
- Synchronized movie and ranking card states
- Proper event handling and propagation
- Form validation and error handling

✅ **UI/UX**
- Dark theme styling
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Intuitive drag-and-drop interface
- Responsive layout

## Usage

The refactored application works exactly the same as before:
1. View movie collection on the left
2. Drag and reorder movies on the right panel
3. Add, edit, or delete movies using the action buttons
4. Search through the movie collection
5. View detailed movie information in modals

## Development

Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173/` with all functionality intact and improved code organization.
